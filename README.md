`hoard` is a program for backing up files from across a filesystem into a single directory
and restoring them later.

Most people will know these programs as "dotfile managers," where dotfiles are configuration
files on *nix (read: non-Windows) systems. Files on *nix systems are marked as hidden by
starting the file name with a dot (`.`).

## Documentation

You can find all documentation at https://hoard.rs.

## Configuration

See [`config.toml.sample`](config.toml.sample) for a documented example configuration file.
