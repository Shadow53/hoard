# Configuration File

This section describes the configuration file structure, with examples in TOML.

> **NOTE:** Hoard supports YAML as well as TOML, for those who prefer the former format. This guide 
> assumes that those using YAML already know the format and expects that said users are able to 
> translate from TOML examples to YAML for their own configurations.
>
> All other users should use TOML, as it is the default format and the one used by the author.
