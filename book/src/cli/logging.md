# Logging

Output verbosity is controlled by the logging level. You can set the logging level with the
`HOARD_LOG` environment variable. Valid values (in decreasing verbosity) are:

- `trace`
- `debug`
- `info`
- `warn`
- `error`

The default logging level is `info` for release builds and `debug` for debugging builds.
